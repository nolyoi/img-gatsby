Dr. Desai was my family doctor for about 18 yrs. He was also my late husband's oncologist. A more caring doctor I couldn't find anywhere. I would still have him as my doctor had I not moved out of state. Still try to see him when ever I'm in the area. I admit I love and miss him not only as my physician but as a friend.
